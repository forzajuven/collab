My name is Daniel Scott.
My favorite food is a steak.

I don't have a favorite pet.  That makes writing a whole paragraph about my favorite pet somewhat challenging.  Maybe I 
should invent a favorite?  For that matter, I could just lie.  Nobody here would know the difference.  So my favorite pet
is a magical unicorn named Reginald P. Monohornington.  He can fly.
